# User Authentication System

This is my first practical project with PHP, where I built a user login and signup system. It helped me understand the basics of backend development and user authentication.

## How It Works

- **Signup**: Users can register by providing their details, which are then saved securely in the database.
- **Login**: Registered users can log in using their credentials.
- **Security**: Passwords are handled securely to ensure user data is protected.

## What I Learned

While building this project, I learned:

- How to connect PHP with a database to store and retrieve user information.
- The importance of securing user data, especially passwords.
- Structuring a basic backend system for user authentication.
- Writing clean and organized code for better readability and maintenance.

This project was an exciting starting point for exploring web development with PHP, and I look forward to building more complex systems in the future!
